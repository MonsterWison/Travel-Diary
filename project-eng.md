- This is Stage 3.5.2 restore point and can be restored at any time.

### Stage 2.1 MVVM Refactoring Updates (July 3, 2025)

#### 🏗️ **Nearby Attractions Feature Implementation - Completed**
- ✅ **Stage 2 Nearby Attractions Search Functionality**
  - Completed NearbyAttractionsModel.swift (Data Model Layer)
  - Completed NearbyAttractionsService.swift (Service Layer)
  - Integrated MKLocalSearch for attraction discovery
  - Implemented Apple Maps-style bottom panel
  - Support for Hidden/Compact/Expanded three panel states
  - Complete attraction categorization system with HIG-compliant icons

- ✅ **Global Attraction Search Support**
  - 15 professional tourism keywords: tourist attraction, landmark, museum, park, temple, beach, viewpoint, cultural center, historic site, famous restaurant, shopping mall, art gallery, botanical garden, national park
  - Completely eliminated junk search content: excludes police station, hospital, MTR, bus station, bank, gas station, etc.
  - 50km search radius, maximum 50 attractions, sorted by distance from nearest to farthest
  - Globally applicable multilingual support

#### 🔧 **Stage 2.1 MVVM Architecture Refactoring - Completed**
- ✅ **Proper MVVM Responsibility Separation**
  - **Model Layer (NearbyAttractionsModel)**: Handles all business logic, data search, processing, sorting, deduplication
  - **ViewModel Layer (LocationViewModel)**: Only coordinates Model and View, handles presentation logic
  - **View Layer (TravelMapView)**: Pure UI display, retrieves data from ViewModel
  - Fully compliant with Apple's official MVVM design pattern standards

- ✅ **Search Logic Optimization**
  - Collect 25 results per keyword to avoid MKLocalSearch rate limiting
  - Merge all results then perform global distance-based sorting
  - Intelligent deduplication retaining nearest duplicate attractions
  - Precisely limit to top 50 nearest attractions

- ✅ **Code Cleanup and Optimization**
  - Removed all filter logic, letting pure search keywords naturally determine results
  - Completely eliminated distance restrictions and POI type filtering
  - Cleaned all DEBUG tracking code
  - Simpler code structure with better maintainability

#### 🚀 **Technical Breakthroughs**
- **Solved search quality issues**: Use pure tourism keywords from source rather than post-filtering
- **Achieved truly nearest 50 attractions**: Global sorting instead of grouped sorting
- **Perfected MVVM architecture**: Model handles business logic, ViewModel coordinates, View displays
- **Enhanced search efficiency**: 25 result limit avoids API rate limiting, ensures stability

#### 📱 **Deployment Status**
- Successfully compiled and deployed to iPhone device "Monster"
- Attraction search functionality works normally
- Bottom panel displays nearest 50 tourism attractions
- All core features remain stable:
  - ✅ Location services with Apple Maps-style location icon
  - ✅ Nearby attractions automatic search and display
  - ✅ Three-stage attraction panel management
  - ✅ Global tourism attraction support

#### 🎯 **Quality Assurance**
